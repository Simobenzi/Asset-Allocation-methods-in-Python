# Asset-Allocation-methods-in-Python

***The Goal*** : This thesis/project aims to understand, review and discuss the most known methodologies used in the field of asset allocation. <br>

***The Project in a nutshell***: We will deepen, respectively, the **Mean Variance optimization**, the **Black Litterman** approach, and the **Bayesian approach**.
For each of this approach, we also found the **GMV portfolio** and computed the relative statistics.
Moreover, for every of these methodologies, we are going to compute all the classical descriptive statistics, i.e., mean, variance, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis, and Sharpe Ratio, in order to make a comparison of the final results.
