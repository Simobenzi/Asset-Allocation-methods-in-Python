# Asset-Allocation-methods-in-Python

This project aims to understand and discuss the most known methodologies used in the field of asset allocation. We will deepen, respectively, the Mean Variance optimization, the Black Litterman approach, and the Bayesian approach.For each of this approach, we also found the GMV portfolio and computed the relative statistics.

Moreover, for every of these methodologies, we are going to compute all the classical descriptive statistics, i.e., mean, variance, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis, and Sharpe Ratio, in order to, at the end, make a comparison of the final results.
